# Photosphere

This is a fork of Photosphere with the code for the 100k demo available here:
https://photosphere-100k.codecapers.com.au/

This repo is a snapshot in time and is not being maintained.

Photosphere is a cross-platform application for managing your photos and videos.

Photosphere is designed to be self-hosted and requires the following resources:
- Host the Docker container
- Provide S3 compatible storage (I used Digital Ocean Spaces, but also works with AWS S3)
- For authentication, use an API key or provide an Auth0 account for authentication.

Contained herein are the code for Photosphere's:
- Backend
- Web frontend
- CLI tool
- Electron app
- Android and iOS apps

Early development of Photosphere was covered in the book [The Feedback-Driven Developer](https://www.manning.com/books/the-feedback-driven-developer).

## Ingesting assets

Photos, videos and folders can be uploaded via the Upload page in the Web frontend.

Alternatively, use the CLI tool for bulk uploads.

To move assets from Google Photos:
- Use Google Takeout to export all your assets to a series of large zip files.
- Then use the upload script on the directory containing the zip files (it can unpack the zip file for you).

## Running Photosphere locally for development

### Pre-reqs

You need [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) installed to run this code. Tested against Bun v1.2.11 on Ubuntu Linux, Windows 10/11 and MacOS.

### Setup

First, clone a local copy of the code repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ashleydavis/photosphere.git
```

Then install all dependencies at the root of the monorepo:

```
cd photosphere
bun install
```

## Project layout

- photosphere/
    - apps - Top level apps live here (frontend, backend, mobile, Electron, cli tool)
    - aux - Auxillary and test projects.
    - packages - Shared code libraries.
    - test - Data for testing.


### Compile the project

THIS STEP IS OPTIONAL

You don't have to compile the project before doing a build. You only should do this step if you change the code and want to make sure the TypeScript code still compiles after you change.

```bash
bun run compile
```

### Start the components that you need

To start the backend, follow the instructions in [./apps/backend/README.md](./apps/backend/README.md).

To start the web-based frontend, follow the instructions in [./apps/frontend/README.md](./apps/frontend/README.md).

To start the Electron-based frontend, follow the instructions in [./electron/README.md](./apps/electron/README.md).

To start the mobile frontend, follow the instructions in [./apps/mobile/README.md](./apps/mobile/README.md).
